"""
Hasan and Mahmud participated in a coding contest, as a result of which they received NN chocolates. Now they
want to divide the chocolates between them equally.
Can you help them by deciding if it is possible for them to divide all the NN chocolates in such a way that
they each get an equal number of chocolates?
You cannot break a chocolate in two or more pieces.

Input Format
* The first line of input will contain a single integer TT, denoting the number of test cases.
* The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer NN - The number of chocolates they received.

Output format
For each test case output the answer on a new line - "Yes" (without quotes)if they can divide chocolates between
them equally, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

Each letter of the output may be printed in either uppercase or.Lowercase, i,e, "Yes", "YES", and "yEs" will all be
treated as equivalent.


Explanation:
Test case 1: They can divide 1010 chocolates such that both of them get 55 chocolates each.
Test case 2: They can divide 44 chocolates such that both of them get 22 chocolates each.
Test case 3: There is no way to divide 33 chocolates so that they get equal number of chocolates.
Test case 4: They can divide 22 chocolates such that both of them get 11 chocolate each.
